                The ocean is divided into five major basins: the Atlantic,
                Pacific, Indian, Southern, and Arctic oceans, with average depth
                of around 12.080 feet (3,682 meters) and temperatures depending
                on its geographical location and depth, which on average is
                around 39°F (3.8°C). Water temperatures are warmer near the
                equator and cooler near the poles, and ocean water is salty,
                with an average salinity of about 35 parts per thousand.
                However, salinity levels can vary depending on factors like
                rainfall, evaporation, and freshwater inputs from rivers and
                streams.

                    found below the ocean, including all plants, animals, and
                    microorganisms that live in the marine environment. The
                    ocean is considered to be one of the most biodiverse places
                    on earth, with estimated more than 230.000 species currency
                    identified, and is still counting.

                    fish, ranging from tiny seahorses to enormous whale sharks.
                    Fish plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, as
                    they are key food sources for many other species, and they
                    also help regulate populations of other marine animals by

                    The ocean also plays the role of maintaining the global
                    climate system and as temperatures continue to rise due to
                    human-caused climate change, sea levels are also rising.
                    This is due in part to the fact that warmer water expands,
                    but also because melting ice from land-based glaciers and
                    ice sheets is flowing into the ocean.

                    Ocean currents play a critical role in regulating the
                    Earth's climate by moving heat from the equator towards the
                    poles. However, as the planet warms, these currents are also
                    shifting, potentially leading to major changes in weather
                    patterns and ocean ecosystems.

                    The ocean is a major sink for carbon dioxide, which is
                    leading to ocean acidification and increased sea surface
                    temperatures. This has significant impacts on marine
                    ecosystems, including coral reefs, fisheries, and

                    Many marine fish stocks are overexploited or depleted due to
                    unsustainable fishing practices, such as bottom trawling,
                    bycatch, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.

                    Human activities such as coastal development, dredging, and
